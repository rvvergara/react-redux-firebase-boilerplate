### Motivation

This is version 2 of [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/rvvergara/react-boilerplate). In this version, I incorporated redux, react-redux, react-router-dom and firebase. Projects utilizing multi-views with routing and data collection using Firebase may use this boilerplate.

### Installation:

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:rvvergara/react-boilerplate.git
```

then:

```
cd react-boilerplate
```

Then run to install (To ensure the packages are updated first run `yarn update` or `npm update` first)

```
yarn
```

or

```
npm -i
```

### Dependencies :

Dependencies are similar with the React only version except for additional packages:

### Dev Dependencies:

Dependencies are similar with the React only version

### package.json scripts:

```
"scripts": {
    "build": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack -p --config config/webpack.prod.js",
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack-dev-server --config config/webpack.dev.js",
    "dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack --config config/webpack.dev.js",
    "test": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test jest --config jest.config.json"
},
```

### Usage (Instructions similar to the React only version with some adjustments based on additional packages and configurations)

### New projects

**After installation modify the following to customize based on project:**

```
change directory name from react-redux-firebase-boilerplate to your project name

src/index.html ** change page title **

src/js/index.js ** remove uncessary template jsx component or keep it for testing app during first time running the dev-server

src/css/base/_base.html ** change any base settings to conform to your project needs

src/css/base/_base.html ** change any or all variables or remove altogether to write entirely your own
```

### Existing Projects:

1. Copy and paste to your package.json's devDepedencies (dependencies directly affecting your work with React):

```
    "@babel/core": "^7.4.3",
    "@babel/plugin-transform-runtime": "^7.4.3",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.4.3",
    "@babel/preset-react": "^7.0.0",
    "babel-cli": "^6.26.0",
    "babel-loader": "^8.0.5",
    "babel-plugin-transform-class-properties": "^6.24.1",
    "cross-env": "^5.2.0",
    "css-loader": "^2.1.1",
    "dotenv": "^8.0.0",
    "enzyme": "^3.9.0",
    "enzyme-adapter-react-16": "^1.12.1",
    "enzyme-to-json": "^3.3.5",
    "eslint": "^5.16.0",
    "eslint-config-airbnb": "^17.1.0",
    "eslint-plugin-import": "^2.17.2",
    "eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y": "^6.2.1",
    "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.12.4",
    "file-loader": "^3.0.1",
    "html-webpack-plugin": "^3.2.0",
    "jest": "^24.7.1",
    "mini-css-extract-plugin": "^0.6.0",
    "node-sass": "^4.11.0",
    "optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin": "^5.0.1",
    "sass-loader": "^7.1.0",
```

2. Copy and paste the following into your package.json's dependencies:

```
    "@babel/runtime": "^7.4.3",
    "normalize.css": "^8.0.1",
    "prop-types": "^15.7.2",
    "react": "^16.8.6",
    "react-dom": "^16.8.6",
    "webpack-merge": "^4.2.1"
```

3. If your project already has a webpack.config.js, make sure you have the following lines:

```
** inside the module rules: **

{
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loader: 'babel-loader',
        options: {
          presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react'],
          plugins: ['transform-class-properties', '@babel/plugin-transform-runtime'],
        },
      },
```

4. If your project uses React Router you may wanna add the following line into the devServer part of webpack config file to ensure that for all routes the server will just render index.html and allow the react router to be the one to change the view (client side rendering):

```
  historyApiFallback: true,
```

5. If you already have jest installed in your project just make sure to create a jest.config.json in the project root and copy the contents in this boilerplate's own jest.config.json

6. To ensure usage of ES2015 import statements in Jest, ensure you have a .babelrc file in the project root (copy the contents in this boilerplate's own .babelrc)

7. If you are unsure which packages and configurations to copy in your project just copy all those that aren't currently not in your package.json, making sure all the scripts are also the same. And copy all webpack related configs in the right directories specified in this boilerplate.

After modifying run to start dev-server:

```
yarn start
```

or

```
npm start
```

### Running Automated Tests

Run for testing currently opened js files:

```
yarn test --watch
```

or

```
npm test --watch
```

Use

```
yarn test --watchAll
```

or

```
npm test --watchAll
```

to run automated tests on all JS files
